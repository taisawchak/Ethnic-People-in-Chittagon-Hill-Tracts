<section id="ethnic-groups">
<p>Lushai Tribe also known as Kuki, Mizo. Lu means 'head', and Shai means 'Cut'. The Lushai tribes were ferocious, and they used to hunt for human skulls. Therefore, they were dreaded by other tribal groups. Lushai ethnic community belongs to the Tibeto-Burman group of the Cino-Tibetan community, speaks the Kuki-Chin family language, and uses the roman alphabets for writings. They are living in the hilly regions of Bandarban and Rangamati hill districts. Lushai population was 1098 according to the 1981 census, but the number showed as 622 on the 1991 census of 124 households in Bangladesh. Their population went down in Bangladesh due to migrating to their ancestors in the neighbouring Mizoram State of India.
Many Lushei tribes have also fled to Myanmar (Burma) to settle there and hunt. Many people regard Lushei and Lushai as the same, but Lushei is the name of a tribal community, while Lushai means a group of tribal communities living in Mizoram. Lushai lives on Jhum (Swidden) cultivation and hunting animal and consumes meats of any kind.
They believed in the creator or Pathien but never believed in hell or heaven. They always had a belief after death, a person is possessed by an incorporeal evil spirit or ghost and uses him/ her the way the evil spirit wishes. At present, they are Christians and are no longer the head hunters. Early 19th century, the Lushei groups used to raid villages in Sylhet, Kachar, Noakhali, Chittagong and CHT and kidnap other people and force them to work for Lushei tribes in their farms. The two British generals led an expedition against the Lushei communities in 1871. The Lushei tribe have a patriarchal society. They never had a king of their own in the past. Every village has a chief, and he is known as Lal.</br>
In case of natural death, the body would be buried in the village. The death by fatal disease would be buried outside the village. In case of accidental death, the body is taken to a distant jungle to suppress. This death customary is maintained so that the deceased’s spirit would not bring any harm to villagers. While an honourable person or Sarder (leader) dies, a coffin would be made out of a large tree and keep the body for one or several months. After a month, they would open the coffin to collect the skull, arms and backbones and preserved them in the house as a token of the family with sufficient respect. These customs have been gradually disappearing from society</p>
<h1>Language</h1>
<p>The modern Mizo people speak the Mizo language, a member of the Sino-Tibetan languages and one of the official languages of Mizoram, along with English, Like the Chinese language, Mizo is a tonal language, meaning one syllable's meaning changes depending on the tone.</br>
Other regional dialects include Hmar, Biate, etc. The Mizos did not have their own ancient script. However, there is a legend that says that the Mizo people used to have their own script. But one day, while all the village went to their farm, a hungry dog ate up all the paper that have the scripts and then the people forgot how to read and write.</br>
Currently, in Mizoram, the Roman script is used to write the Mizo language using the Hunterian transliteration. Locally, it is commonly known as the Mizo A AW B, or Mizo Hawrawp. The Mizo language can be read by 91.3% of the population of Mizoram, making the state to have the third-highest literacy rates in India. </p>
<h1>Culture and society : </h1>
<p>The Mizo culture is diverse and rich due to the various tribes and clans. After the 19th century, it has been heavily based on Christianity—the main festival of the Mizos is Christmas, or locally known as Krismas. In addition, the attire for men are influenced by the Western culture; they wear coats. Even though the Mizos still valued their ancient customs and values, much has changed beyond recognition. There has been a recent trend toward going back to the basics. </p>
<h4>Art and Craft </h4>
<p>A wide range of art and craft products are sold at Mizoram's markets. The main subset of craftwork is textiles, bamboo, cane, and basketry. Many women engage in weaving and basketry, but because Mizoram is known for its expertise in bamboo cane craftwork, the bamboo cane industry blossoms and prospers. Besides producing bamboo baskets, the Indian economic census covered that Mizo artisans create cane stools, gourd crafts, and pottery across its districts and subdivisions. </p>
<h4>Cuisine</h4>
<p>The majority of the non-vegetarian dishes eaten by the Mizos are served on banana leaves and are representative of rich cuisine. When preparing cuisine, mustard oil is utilized along with spices like garlic, ginger, and chilli. They have less spice in their diet than other places. Their staple food is rice, which they pair with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian curries. The scent of the food is provided by the usage of bamboo shoots. Bai (a stew made with a variety of veggies), Vawksa Rep (smoked pork), Buhchiar (porridge) and Arsa Buhchiar (chicken porridge) are a few examples of classic Mizo dishes. </p>
<h4>Dance</h4>
<p>Mizo people are excellent in performing arts. Cheraw dance, also referred to as the bamboo dance, is considered to be the oldest dance of the Mizos, dating back until the 1st century while the Mizos were still in Chhinlung, China before their great migration. The dance is now performed in almost all festivals and occasions. Other dances include Chheih Lam, Khual Lam, Chai Lam, Tlang Lam, Par Lam, and Sarlamkai. Note that Lam in Mizo means dance.</p>
<h4>Musical instruments</h4>
<p>From time immemorial, the Mizos have been using different musical instruments. They can broadly be divided into three striking instruments, wind instruments, and stringed instruments.</br>
•	Striking instruments include the Khuang (drum), Dár (gong), Darkhuang/Zamluang (large brass drum), Darbu (three-note gong), Darmang (small gong), Bengbung (xylophone-like instrument), Talhkhuang, and Seki (hollow horns).</br>
•	Wind instruments include the Rawchhem (bagpipe-like instrument), Tumphit, Tawtawrawt (bamboo trumpet), Phenglawng (bamboo flute), Buhchangkuang (Reed or paddy stalk flute), and Hnahtum (leaf).</br>
•	Stringed instruments include the Ṭingṭang (pronounced treeng-trang, guitar), Lemlawi (harp), and Tuium Dar (three strings with unique notes each).</br>
Khuang is the only Mizo traditional musical instrument that is popularly used in the present day. In the olden days, Khuang had no role in religious functions; but today, the use of Khuang is a must in every church service. </p>
<h4>Traditional clothing</h4>
<p>A typical Mizo traditional attire for men comes with a big puan that varies colors, and different style of wearing it. They wear a shorter puan that are above the knees at the bottom. In order to protect themselves from the heat during the summer, they are often seen with clothing around their waists and a type of turban on their heads. In modern days, people prefer t-shirts with traditional patterns.</br>
There are numerous Mizo women's traditional outfits. The most popular one is the Puan, which has three items of clothing—a shirt, a pair of leggings, and a head covering that resembles a dupatta—and is pretty similar to a churidar and a kurta. Even though puan is one of their favorite outfits, they like to wear Puanchei on special occasions and during weddings. It is essentially a two-piece outfit with a top or shirt worn over the long skirt-like lower portion. The stunning blouse is called Kawrchei. It is hand woven from cotton stuff. When dancing, the blouse is frequently paired with puanchei. These have typically vivid colors and chequered patterns.</p>
<h4>Religion</h4>
<h5>Sakhua </h5>
<p>Pre-colonialist Mizos were animists, i.e. they followed Lushai animism in which the Lushai tribes believed in nature-based spirits and other natural living objects. </p>
<h5>Christianity</h5>
<p>Mizo people were influenced by British missionaries in the 19th century, as the British Raj subjugated the chieftainship under its dominance, which they later abolished by Assam-Lushai District (Acquisition of Chief's Rights) Act, 1954. The spread of education by Christian missionaries led to a high literacy rate of 91.58% by 2011. Almost all the Mizos also adopted Christianity, and most continue to be so till the present day. </p>
<h5>Bnei Menashe</h5>
<p>In the 19th century, European Christian missionary activity in the region led to conversion of some Chin, Kuki, and Mizo peoples. In the mid-to-late 20th century, a rather small number of Mizo and related ethnic peoples in Assam and Mizoram began practicing Judaism, after a community leader had a dream in 1951 that they were descendants of the biblical figure Manasseh, a lost tribe of Israel. They number, at most, several thousand in a population of more than 3.7 million in these states. Genetic studies have shown very low affinity with Middle Eastern peoples (including ethnic Jews), and rabbinic authorities in Israel have acknowledged Bnei Menashe people as Jews subsequent to their conversion to Judaism under normative Jewish practices. Several hundred have already emigrated to Israel, where they must undergo complete conversion to be accepted as Jews.</p>
