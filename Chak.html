<a href="ethnic-groups">Chak</a></nav>
<section id="ethnic-groups">
<p>The Chak are an indigenous ethnic group in Bangladesh. They primarily reside in the Bandarban district, specifically in the Naikhongchhari upazila, as well as in the Rakhine state of Myanmar and Arunachal Pradesh in India. The language spoken by the Chak is known as the Chak language. In the Chak language, the word "Chak" means "to stand." While the Chak write "Chak" at the end of their names, the Rakhine refer to them as "Sak" (Sak) and sometimes "Mingsak." The Chak refer to themselves as "Achak." In the Bomang circle of Bandarban, the Chak are listed under the name "Mingsak" during the royal installation ceremony.</p>
<h1>Population</h1>
<p>Population: Among the thirteen to fourteen indigenous ethnic groups in the Chittagong hill tracts, the Chak are one of them. According to the 1991 census, the Chak population in Bangladesh was approximately 2,000, while there were about 20,000 in Myanmar (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2002). However, the current estimate of the Chak population in Bangladesh is around 5,000.</p>
<h1>Location</h1>
<p>The Chak community resides in various areas of the Chittagong hill tracts, including Baishari, Naikhongchhari, Alikadam, Kamichhara, Kwanjiri, Bakkhali, Dochhari, Badurjiri, and Krokyang.</br>
</br>The Chak community is mentioned in Francis Buchanan's travelogue, "Francis Buchanon in South East Bengal" (1798). During a significant political crisis in Burma and Arakan in the 14th-15th centuries, due to insecurity, part of the Chak population crossed the Kaladeng River and the Chengdang mountain range to settle in the hilly regions of present-day Bangladesh, specifically in Lama and Yechow.</p>
<h1>Occupation</h1>
<p>The Chak community traditionally engages in agriculture, primarily through shifting cultivation (jhum) and plowing. However, the yields from jhum cultivation have declined over time. With the passage of time, the Chak people have made significant progress in education. Currently, many Chak individuals are employed in various government and private institutions across the country.</p>
<h1>Language</h1>
<p>The language spoken by the Chak is known as the Chak language. The Chak community belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family and speaks a language that is part of the Tibeto-Burman branch. Historically, the Chak in Bangladesh did not have a written script, but today, most people have heard of their script. This script was created by Mongmong Chak, who was the first to develop a written form of the Chak language and documented the word "Chak" in books. Previously, although they referred to themselves as Chak, the title "Chak" was not written at the end of their names in official documents. Additionally, Mongmong Chak was the first among the Chak to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p>
<h1>Clothing</h1>
<p>Men's clothing includes "Kotingpangre" (dhoti) and "Apang" (head scarf), while women's attire consists of "Nafing" (a type of skirt) and "Rankeng" (a bodice). The Chak also weave thick patterned blankets. They wear jewelry made with unique designs. Notable pieces of jewelry include large earrings (Kanvas Natang Beng Chingju), wooden ear studs (Tangachangnatang), and ankle ornaments (Atapaisang). The large earrings are considered a distinctive piece of jewelry among them.</p>
<h1>Lifestyle</h1>
<p>The lifestyle of the Chak is diverse and rich in traditions. Aside from nominal similarities, there is no linguistic or cultural connection between the Chak and Chakma people.
</br>
</br>
Physically, the Chak belong to the Mongoloid race, characterized by a yellowish complexion, a broad and flat nose, medium-sized facial features, and folded eyelids. The Chak society is primarily divided into two clans, which are further divided into several sub-clans. The clan symbol is known as "Jaloya" or "Poitaya" (a twisted thread). In Chinese history, the Chak living in Yunan are referred to as the "Big Ear People." There was a tradition among Chak women of wearing large earrings, but this practice is now nearly extinct.
</br>
</br>
The Chak people have their own script, religion, culture, folklore, songs, rhymes, and poetry. They celebrate various festivals, including "Labre" (during the full moon in Agrahayan), "Sangrai," "Kathin Poye" (offering of robes), "Katang Yishu Poh," "Tengchongbuk Labre" (during the full moon in Kartik), and "Angnaibuk Poye" (Nabanna festival).
</br>
</br>
In the patriarchal family structure of the Chak, three types of families can be observed. The headman, who receives a stipend from the government, is appointed based on qualifications and inheritance. Only males are considered heirs to property.
</br>
</br>
The Chak refer to their houses as "King" and their villages as "Thing."
</br>
</br>
The clan system includes unique songs performed to bless newborns and promote their well-being. Additionally, through various cultural practices observed at different life stages, the Chak have established their own distinct identity.</p>
<h1>Childbirth and Naming Ceremonies</h1>
<p>Significant rituals related to childbirth and naming include "Naingchahang" (positioning), "Putrongbuwey" (postnatal ceremony), and "Veglunsat Po" (name-giving).</p>
<h1>Marriage law</h1>
<P>There are primarily two clans: 'Ando' and 'Ngarek.' Within these two main clans, there are several sub-clans. Among the marriage customs are "Achangyayuga" (bride viewing) and "Changyayuga" (clan checking), along with many other traditions.Marriage between boys and girls from the same clan is prohibited. Those who violate this rule face social exclusion.</P>
<h1>Religion</h1>
<p>The Chak primarily follow Buddhism, although there are also many Christians among them.</p>
<h1>Food</h1>
<p>The Chak eat rice, vegetables, dried fish, fish, and meat. Their favorite foods include "Kainrabung" and "Kaindak."</p>
<h1>Death Rituals</h1>
<p>The deceased are cremated at the funeral pyre. Relatives of the deceased offer rice at a Buddhist temple for seven days to pray for the soul's well-being. Notable practices related to death include "Kabake Shoyon" (laying the body), "Talakh" (burial), cremation, "Kangboeng" (purification), "Chaningwak Shabik Freh," and "Sain Bolb" (praying for rebirth), which are significant aspects of Chak culture.
</br>
</br>
The Chak have a specific practice called "Apengja" (body rights). According to this practice, the right to perform the funeral rites for a male individual belongs to his maternal uncle or cousin. Conversely, for a female, the right to perform the rites is held by her paternal uncle or nephew.</p>
